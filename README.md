# 🤖 ROGER – AI Voice Assistant  

ROGER is a **Python-based AI Voice Assistant** that combines **speech recognition, AI conversation, automation, and a graphical interface** into one intelligent system.

This project demonstrates **AI integration, software architecture, and real-world automation**, built as a modular assistant similar to a mini virtual Jarvis.

## 🚀 Features  

🎤 **Speech Recognition** – Converts voice commands into text  
🔊 **Text-to-Speech** – Roger responds with a natural voice  
💬 **AI Chat System** – Conversational intelligence  
🌍 **Real-Time Web Search** – Fetches live information  
🖥️ **GUI Interface** – Interactive desktop assistant window  
⚙️ **Automation** – Open apps, perform system tasks  
🧠 **Decision-Making Model** – Determines user intent  
🔎 **YouTube & Google Control**  
🌐 **Translation Support**

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

Roger is designed using a **modular architecture**:

```
Frontend (GUI)
      ↓
Speech Layer (STT / TTS)
      ↓
Decision Layer (Command Understanding)
      ↓
AI Processing (Chatbot + Search)
      ↓
Automation Layer (System / App Control)
```

This structure makes the assistant scalable and easy to improve.

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `Main.py` | Central controller of the assistant |
| `Frontend/GUI` | User interface |
| `SpeechRecognition.py` | Voice to text processing |
| `TextToSpeech.py` | Assistant voice responses |
| `ChatBot.py` | Conversational AI |
| `RealtimeSearchEngine.py` | Internet search |
| `Automation.py` | Opens apps & performs tasks |
| `FirstLayerDMM.py` | Decision-making module |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

**Languages:**  
- Python  

**Libraries & Tools:**  
- PyQt5 (GUI)  
- SpeechRecognition  
- Edge-TTS  
- Selenium  
- BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping)

## ⚡ How It Works  

1. User speaks a command 🎤  
2. Speech is converted to text  
3. System analyzes the intent  
4. Roger either:
   - Talks back 🤖  
   - Searches online 🌍  
   - Performs automation ⚙️
